You can print the image above and include them in your backups so you would have a copy of paperify with them. :)

## Requirements

Make sure you have these binaries installed on your system.

 - `qrencode` (qrencode)
 - `convert` (imagemagick)
 - `zbarimg` (zbar >= 0.23.1) __only for decoding with digitallify.sh__
 
**Zbar**: Binary support is just added in zbar `0.23.1` and not supported in earlier versions.
Please verify that your zbar version is higher or equal to `0.23.1`. You can do that by running 
```
zbarimg --version
0.23.1
```
You can download and build zbar from [github.com/mchehab/zbar/](https://github.com/mchehab/zbar/).
Note that zbar is **not** required for `paperify.sh` It is only required for `digitallify.sh` decoding.

### Mac OS X

To install the requirements you can use Homebrew.

```
brew install coreutils qrencode zbar
```

## Installation

```
# To Paperify
# FIRST: cd into the folder that your file is in
docker run -v$(pwd):/target alisinabh/paperify FILE

# To Digitallify
# First cd into the folder that your scanned images are in
docker run -v$(pwd):/target --entrypoint=/paperify/digitallify.sh alisinabh/paperify OUTPUT_FILE .

## Recommendations

### Multiple files

Use tarballs and gzip to store and compress your data.
```
tar cvfz files.tgz file1.txt file2.txt
```

### Encryption

To protect your data you can encrypt them using `gpg` (GnuPG).
```
gpg --symmetric file.txt
```
Then use `file.txt.gpg` in paperify.
